The following project uses yolov2 to train a dataset containing 150 car images to detect scratches spots and dents.
The training data is in the images folder and the testing output is in the the_image_test folder.
The annotations has been made using the "generate_xml.py" and "drawboxes.py" in which the "drawboxes.py" was used to draw bounding boxes on the areas of interest and the  "generate_xml.py" was used to generate the xml file of the required format(format as mentioned in https://github.com/thtrieu/darkflow)
